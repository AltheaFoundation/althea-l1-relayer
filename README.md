# Althea L1 Gassless relayer

The Althea L1 gassless relayer is an ecosystem wide system for allowing a market of relayers to submit 'gasless' transactions. These are transactions where the user does not have ALTHEA but wishes to pay their transaction fee in another token.

The relayer application queries various transaction sources and relays transactions when they are available with a required profit margin between the provided payment token and the value of ALTEHA required to actually execute the transaction.
